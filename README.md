# LSD-Explorer-v1.2

Check the releases for updates and changes here https://github.com/rofarrel/LSD-Explorer/releases

How to Use:

Click the button to Download/Clone the repository and download the .zip folder.

Extract the contents of the .zip folder after finished downloading.

Run the "LSD-Explorer by Riley O'Farrell" application in the LSD-Explorer-RO folder.

**NOTES**

If the app loads only a white screen, press "View" then "Reload" and that should load the app.

This __only__ runs on Windows. I have not created a MacOS compatible version yet. If you are on a mac, you have 2 options. The easiest option is to run the R code yourself in RStudio. The code is found in the Resource->app folder and is the "app.r" file. The other way for you to run the program is to use a virtual machine on your mac and run windows on the virtual machine.
